# GoGeddesGo

This game is a humorous simulation of QEA 2. The goal of the game is to reach the A+ with your Neato vacuum before
John Geddes reaches Scotland. You control the Neato with the arrow keys dodging bullets. You lose if John reaches
Scotland or you get hit by a bullet. You win by reaching the A+ without either of those things happening. You run
the game by executing the game.py file. 

This game was built on PyGame, and uses the `pygame` library to handle all functionality. You can install pygame
via the command `pip install pygame`.
